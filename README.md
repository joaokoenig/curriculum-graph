# curriculum-graph

![PNG preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zambonin/curriculum-graph/master/tree.png)

An attempt to organize and update the old course progression tree used by
compsci students of UFSC. The programs for each course were added as links to
each respective box on the SVG version. Powered by [draw.io](http://draw.io/).
The LaTeX version uses the `tikz` package.

Optional and other courses may be found at
[planos.inf.ufsc.br](http://planos.inf.ufsc.br/).

For critics and suggestions: `gustavo.zambonin at grad.ufsc.br`.
